## Requirements
1. To set up the project ensure that you have [poetry installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
1. Clone this repo and navigate to its directory in terminal
1. Execute `poetry install .`
1. If running scripts at terminal, call them with `poetry run python <nameofscript>`; otherwise ensure your IDE is using a poetry virtual environment (pycharm does this with a click)
